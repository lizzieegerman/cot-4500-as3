Description For this assignment:
We are using Euler's method and the Runge-Kutta method to print out a number with the specified information given in the assignment. We also code in python to use the Guassian elimination method to solve an augmented matrix. We use the LU factorization to print out the determinant, the L, and the U matrix. And we find out if a matrix is a matrix is diagonally dominate and if another matrix is positive definite based on what was given.

Installation:
Use init.py to import any packages. For this assignment, only numpy was required. To get this, you will type "import numpy as np". There is no need for the requirements.txt since we only need numpy, however I included it as well as a precaution. This would be necessary if you needed to install packages other than numpy.

Running the program In the command line you will hit the triangle button the run the program.
